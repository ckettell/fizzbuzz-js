# Week Two

## Monday, 1st July

### Morning, OO Relationship - Forwarding and Polymorphism
- Spent the morning focusing on forwarding. I get the principle.
- In Makers' example, they highlighted that a class could be split into two, noting that there are two clear groups of methods.
- I was unable to complete the challenge in the morning but have almost completed it now.

### Afternoon, Oystercard
- Worked with Loic.
- Used the learnings from week one and was able to get through the task at a productive pace.
- Task started with setting up environment. This included getting gems and using bundler.

## Tuesday, 2nd July

### Morning, Domain Modelling Workshop
- UML is a good resource for this. We were looking at planning out our code before going. Really useful but I don't think I'm currently very good at this.

### Afternoon, Oystercard
- Paired with James. We made good process but got a little stuck on step 14.

## Wednesday, 3rd July

### Morning, Weekly Practicals

### Takeaway App
- Enjoyed working on this. Made an effort to give classes their own responsibilities and ensuring methods represented this too.
- First time I knowingly used an API. This was to send a text with an order confirming the method had been executed.
