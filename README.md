# Week Two

## Monday, 1st July

### Morning, OO Relationship - Forwarding and Polymorphism
- Spent the morning focusing on forwarding. I get the principle.
- In Makers' example, they highlighted that a class could be split into two, noting that there are two clear groups of methods.
- I was unable to complete the challenge in the morning but have almost completed it now.

### Afternoon, Oystercard
