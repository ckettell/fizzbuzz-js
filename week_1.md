# Week One

## Tuesday, 25th June

### Morning, Debugging
- Slow start with the FizzBuzz task. 
- Then enjoyed completing the Cipher challenge as I built my understanding. Using p was helpful. 

#### Afternoon, Boris Bikes
- Teamed up with Ted and Ian. 
- Hands on with TDD. I didn't test out much of the syntax, however found that using this really broke the task down. Through this technique, we were just figuring out what tests to run.

### Morning, Class research
- Submitted article to Makers blog. 
- Spent working on classes. I was (still am) confused about how they worked. This was when introducing instance variables and accessors. 
- I found in this session that this is when getter and setters are used. 
- Instance variables. These are visible throughout the object. Gives a variable when creating a new instance of the class object. 


### Afternoon, Boris Bikes.
- Worked with Dan. 
- Testing on the dock method. Here, we were checking if there is a bike there and it would take a bike parameter which would be assigned to a bike instance variable. 
- Created a guard condition. This is the first point of contact in a method and will catch out if there is already a bike in the bay.

#### Feedback
- From Dan. 
- very thorough and patient with me whilst I struggled to understand everything we were covering. As a dev I could see that this patience would be an exceptional trait. Love also that you're keen to understand more of the 'why' on the learnings, not just the how.
- One thing to keep doing - being kind in your way of communicating
- One thing to look at changing - be confident to read through the exercise (and even the next exercise) and come back to a problem with a wider understanding.
