# Week Three

## Monday, 8th July

### Morning, Intro to the Web
- Introduced to a bunch of new concepts. These included MVC, HTTP methods and the request and response cycle.

### Afternoon, Battle
- Paired with Kareem.
- This included incorporating Ruby with HTML. I think the process here was using ERB.
- Internet research of ERB says that it provides an easy to use templating system for Ruby. With ERB, Ruby code can be added to any plain text document.

## Tuesday, 9th July

### Morning, Process Modelling
- Prior to the workshop, I spent the morning reading about the request and response cycle.
- Read about HTTP being used to communicate information between two pieces of software.
- Some of the important things which were highlighted when using HTTP were: URI (this is like a unique identifier), methods (GET, POST, HEAD etc - these are just conventions and I don't believe actually do a right lot.) and headers (additional date sent by the user agent to give more context about the transaction going on between the client and server).

### Afternoon, Battle
- Paired with Frank.
- Took a while to get set up. Teething issues when setting Capybara up. Lessons learned.

## Wednesday, 10th July

### Afternoon, Battle
- Paired with Richie.
- Made some good progress. Good conversation with Sam, our coach, about the use of get and post. Although conventions, can arguably see the two as front and backend.

## Thursday, 11th July

### Afternoon, Battle
- Paired with Leo.
- Made some good progress and was able to explain the tests.

## Friday, 12th July

### Afternoon, Battle
- Paired with Renata.
- Able to complete the task. Many gaps in my knwledge towards the end. I think looking at databases next week will be important.
